# Pattern Registry (Internal)

Record coding/architectural patterns used in CSV Detox.
Update only after asking and receiving approval for new patterns/libraries.

## Current patterns

### Folder conventions
- `src/lib/**` contains pure logic (parsers, validators, utilities, business logic)
- `src/app/**` contains Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- `src/components/ui/**` contains shadcn/ui components (auto-generated, customizable)
- `src/components/**` contains application-specific React components
- `convex/**` contains Convex backend code (schema, mutations, queries)

### Backend: Convex + Postgres
- **Convex** is used as the backend-as-a-service platform
- **Convex file storage** stores uploaded files (CSV/XLSX)
- **Database**: Convex's built-in document database stores metadata
- **Postgres integration**: Available via Convex dashboard for future relational features
- File IDs are generated by the Convex database (not client-side UUIDs)

### File Upload Pattern
- Client calls `generateUploadUrl` mutation to get upload URL
- Client uploads file directly to Convex storage
- Client calls `uploadFile` mutation with storage ID + metadata
- Mutation validates file and stores metadata in database
- All validation logic lives in Convex mutations (server-side)

### React Integration
- `ConvexProvider` wraps the app in `layout.tsx`
- Pages use `useMutation` and `useQuery` hooks from `convex/react`
- All Convex functions are strongly typed via generated API (`convex/_generated/api`)

### UI Components: shadcn/ui
- **Component library**: shadcn/ui (Tailwind CSS-based, copy-paste components)
- **Installation**: `npx shadcn@latest add <component>` - components are copied to `src/components/ui/`
- **Customization**: Edit components in `src/components/ui/` after installation as needed
- **Styling**: Uses Tailwind CSS utility classes
- **Philosophy**: Components are owned by the project (not npm dependencies), allowing full customization
- **Common components**:
  - `button` - Buttons with variants (default, destructive, outline, ghost, link)
  - `card` - Cards with header, content, footer
  - `table` - Data tables with sorting, filtering
  - `dialog` - Modal dialogs
  - `select` - Dropdown selects
  - `input` - Form inputs
- **Pattern**: Use shadcn/ui as the base, compose application-specific components in `src/components/`
- **Documentation**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs

### Testing Patterns
- **Framework**: Node.js built-in test runner with tsx for TypeScript support
- **Test location**: `__tests__` directories next to the code being tested
- **Test naming**: `*.test.ts` files
- **Unit tests**: Pure functions in `src/lib/**` are unit tested in isolation
- **Integration tests**: Convex mutations tested using Convex test helpers (future)
- **Run tests**: `npm test` - runs all tests, exits with code 0 on success
- **Watch mode**: `npm run test:watch` - reruns tests on file changes
- **Coverage**: All validation logic must have >90% test coverage
- **Test structure**: Use `describe` for grouping, `it` for individual tests
- **Assertions**: Use Node's built-in `assert` module

### Planned
- DuckDB for preview/export execution patterns (to be documented when implemented)
- Authorization approach (to be documented when introduced)
